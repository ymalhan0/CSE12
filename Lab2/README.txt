Lab 2: Simple Data Path


Description:
In this lab, you will be building a register file that contains 4-bit registers. Each of the four registers has an address and stores a 4-bit value. The value saved to a destination register (write register) will come from one of two sources, the keypad user input, or the output of the ALU. The ALU in this system is a 4-bit bitwise left rotation (left circular shift) circuit that takes two of the register values as inputs (read registers).




Files:
Lab2.lgi

This file includes the registers and ALU created to rotate an input a given amount of times.



Instructions:
This program is intended to be run using Multimedia Logic (MMLogic or MML).
