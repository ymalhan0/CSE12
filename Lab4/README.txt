Lab 4: Functions and Graphics


Description:
In this lab, you will implement functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. These functions will allow users to change the background color of the display, and “draw” horizontal and vertical lines on the display. To simulate a display, we’ll be using the memory-mapped bitmap graphics display tool included with MARS





Files:
lab4.asm

This file includes the function definitions used ignorer to print a graphic of lines and pixels.


lab_s21_test.asm

This file is used to test lab4.asm to ensure the correct bit map is displayed.



Instructions:
This program is intended to be run using the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (MARS).
